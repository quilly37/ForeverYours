        <div class="event">
          <strong>Oct 2024</strong>
          <p>We met in Valorant. You said “hi.” I didn’t know then that you’d become my favorite one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>Jan 20, Midnight</strong>
          <p>You said, “I love you. Answer tonight or I won’t let you sleep.”<br>
          I wrote “I love you” on paper and showed you through the screen. We talked all night. You made me laugh until I cried.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>June 15, Mumbai</strong>
          <p>I asked you to come to Siddi Vinayak… but I sent you to the wrong place 😅<br>
          So we met at Gateway instead. I saw you… and my heart forgot how to work.<br>
          I wanted to run and hug you so tight. And later — in Jio World Mall — I finally did.<br>
          That kiss? Still gives me butterflies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>Origami & Art Night</strong>
          <p>We made paper flowers. Yours was perfect. Mine? A crumpled mess.<br>
          Then you drew my portrait — it looked like me!<br>
          When I drew yours… you looked like a potato with glasses 😂<br>
          We laughed until our stomachs hurt. That’s my favorite kind of love.</p>

    <section class="birthday">
      <h2>I Forgot Your Birthday…</h2>
      <p>
        And I felt like the worst girlfriend ever.<br>
        You mean more to me than anything — and I missed it.<br><br>

        But here’s the truth: I think of you every second.<br>
        You’re my best friend, my therapist, my guardian, my mentor.<br>
        You motivate me. You believe in me. You never judge me.<br><br>

        So yes, I forgot the date…<br>
        But I could <em>never</em> forget <strong>you</strong>.<br>
        And I promise — next year, I’ll make it the best day of your life. 🎉

      <h2>Reasons I Love You</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You never gave up on me, even when I was being a silly, dramatic mess.</li>
        <li>You teach me things — not just facts, but how to be brave.</li>
        <li>You let me prank your Instagram and text your friends. (And you laugh!)</li>
        <li>You’re my partner, my motivator, my inspirer, my safe place.</li>
        <li>You make me believe I can do something big — because you believe it too.</li>
        <li>Every night, I fall asleep imagining you beside me, holding me.</li>
        <li>And every morning, I wake up dreaming of our future.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Every time you speak about how you wanna embrace me gives me butterflies</li>
        <li>Your three-syllable “<strong>baaaay-beee</strong>” that makes me melt.</li>
        <li>The way we play games on Google Meet and pretend we’re in the same room.</li>
        <li>Watching movies together while texting reactions like we’re at a sleepover.</li>
        <li>Earlier I used to say “I’m single!” while you used to send me <3 every 5 minutes.</li>

        You’re not just my boyfriend.<br>

        My calm in the chaos.<br>
        My reason to be better.<br><br>

        I love you more than words can say.<br>
        More than memes, more than coffee, more than my phone battery.<br><br>

        I can’t wait to build a life with you — one where I never have to say “goodnight” across a screen.<br><br>
